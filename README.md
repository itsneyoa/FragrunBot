# Fragruns bot

A bot written by [SergeantSar](https://github.com/SergeantSar) and [neyoa](https://github.com/itsneyoa) because we couldn't find any open source ones and the public ones keep getting banned

> Warning - Hypixel has a history of banning these bots without a reason. As there is no official statement yet this is entirely use at your own risk!
