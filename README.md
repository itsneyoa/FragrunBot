### Roadmap

- [ ] Add a queue
    - Currently it just joins a party, waits for 10s then leaves. It would by much better for it to have a queue of players to join after it leaves one party.
- [ ] Restrict usage
    - Have an optional setting to only allow certain players to use or have a blacklist of players. This is currently done via the ingame privacy settings, which isn't great.
- [ ] Make bot autoreconnect is kicked
    - Pretty self-explanitory
